## About ##

No full page reloads, loads new content in via ajax, most of the animations are done using CSS3 transitions/animations, stylesheets are written using SCSS, fully responsive and built mobile-first, modular javascript, uses Grunt to: work locally with livereload, minify CSS and JavaScript, optimize images, and create ready to go dist directory.

*  ~~Convert all CSS to SCSS~~
*  ~~Trying to get all resources as small as possible in order to reduce amount of bandwidth used on mobile~~
*  Lazy load or intelligently load images
*  ~~Shift my attention to work-flow~~
*  ~~Add content for the #entrance hash~~
*  ~~Update each portfolio gallery item~~
*  ~~Cleaning up the super big slider~~
*  ~~Markup for the site lives in three different places: index.html, subPagesDocument.html, and main.js.~~
*  ~~Rewrite all the copy associated with the gallery items so they are the correct length~~
*  ~~Build a better light box~~
