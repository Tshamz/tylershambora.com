## Goals ##

*  Would like to minify everything, not just the CSS
*  Working on writing more modular and efficient CSS with the help of SCSS and SMACSS
*  Trying to get all resources as small as possible and unnoticeable in order to reduce amount of bandwidth used on mobile
*  Hoping to shift my attention to work-flow for the remainder of this project in order to become more familiar with a number of tools (Yeoman, LiveReload, Grunt, Bower, etc.)
*  Actually adding content for the landing/splash page, also known as the #entrance hash
*  Finally updating each portfolio gallery item so it's no longer all the same placeholder content
*  Cleaning up the (min-width: 75rem) slider so it doesn't look bad

kbye.
