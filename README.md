About friggin' time...

Check out [tylershambora.com](http://tylershambora.com) for an up to date, live version of the site.

## About ##

No full page reloads, loads new content in via ajax, most of the animations are done using CSS3 transitions/animations, stylesheets are written using SCSS, fully responsive and built mobile-first, uses Grunt to: work locally with livereload, minify CSS and JavaScript, optimize images, and create ready to go dist directory.

## Goals ##

*  ~~Would like to minify CSS & JS~~
*  ~~Convert all CSS to SCSS~~
*  ~~Trying to get all resources as small as possible in order to reduce amount of bandwidth used on mobile~~
*  Lazy load or intelligently load images
*  ~~Shift my attention to work-flow~~
*  ~~Add content for the #entrance hash~~
*  ~~Update each portfolio gallery item ~~
*  ~~Cleaning up the super big slider~~
*  Markup for the site lives in three different places: index.html, subPagesDocument.html, and main.js. It would be nice to do one of a few things: Get everything in the same place under the same file type, at least abstract the HTML in the JavaScript into a separate JS file and do a little more robust templating..., or just do something different than what I'm doing now, cause right now what I'm doing is madness.
*  Knock off all the TODOs
*  Rewrite all the copy associated with the gallery items so they are the correct length
*  Build a better light box
*  Look into more about support for pointer-events

kbye.
