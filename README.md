About friggin' time...

Check out [tylershambora.com](http://tylershambora.com) for an up to date, live version of the site.

## Goals ##

*  ~~Would like to minify everything, not just the CSS~~ (Don't want to minimize or obfuscate the HTML, so CSS & JavaScript are fine)
*  Working on writing more modular and efficient CSS with the help of SCSS ~~and SMACSS~~ (SMACSS not really applicable here due to the site's size and how it's written)
*  ~~Trying to get all resources as small as possible and unnoticeable in order to reduce amount of bandwidth used on mobile~~ (Done more or less, but I'd like to start intelligently loading the images so that images at the top of the page that are initially visible load quickly, and images at the bottom that aren't seen initially, load later)
*  ~~Hoping to shift my attention to work-flow for the remainder of this project in order to become more familiar with a number of tools (Yeoman, LiveReload, Grunt, Bower, etc.)~~ (Implemented Grunt, LiveReload, and Grunt-Watch to re-compile my scss files when they're changed)
*  ~~Actually adding content for the landing/splash page, also known as the #entrance hash~~ (Done. Pretty pleased with the result)
*  ~~Finally updating each portfolio gallery item so it's no longer all the same placeholder content~~ (Done, although I think I'd like to go back and clean up the copy)
*  ~~Cleaning up the (min-width: 75rem) slider so it doesn't look bad~~ (Done, although the slider still kinda looks/feels kinda rough around the edges)

kbye.
