    NOTES
=================================================================================

1.  IDs should only used on the outermost elements (one level below body, e.g.
    main), elements that contain significant portions of content (the mini-pages
    injected into the <main id="guts"> container), or elements that are used often
    as hooks in regards to scripting (again, the <main id="guts"> container). The
    reason for this is: a) Because I feel that IDs are good at indicating what is
    and isn't a large, macro level container of content, and b) to easily target a
    specific instance of reused content (for example, instead of creating a
    ".no-border" class with "border: none;", only using it in one instance, and
    introducing presentation into the structure, the same, single-serving style
    may be applied with, #resume .marquee-image, put in a "_resume.scss" partial,
    and eventually imported into a styles.scss file, which is then later minified).

2.  Ordering of properties inside of selectors
