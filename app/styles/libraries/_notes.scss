    NOTES
===============================================================================

1.  IDs should only be used:
      a. When it follows the spec (e.g. only one instance on page)
      b. To describe unsemantic markup, when appropriate (see above)
      c. On elements that serve as containers for a section (e.g. #no-support)
      d. As hooks for JavaScript (e.g. #unsupported-features)
      e. To target a specific instance of a class (#resume .marquee-image)

2.  I'm not a very good speller

3.  Selectors begin with a descriptive ID or class for easy debugging purposes

4.  Use of !important is frowned upon, but at times necessary

5.  All measurements are in REM or %

6.  An exception to the that last rule is on tiny measurements (e.g. border)

7.  Use data:uris on small, plain images

8.  Readability is favored over performance

9. I try not to target elements using tag selectors as much as possible

10. Exceptions to that last rule will be preceded with a descriptive ID or class

11. Exceptions are tags that are pretty semantic (e.g. img, p, nav)

12. I try not to add classes just for the sake of styling as much as possible

13. When rules 10 and 12 conflict, I try to choose what's best

14. Occasionally, I like to use joined class selectors (.a.b) for readability

15. Nesting beyond 3 levels is frowned upon, and even beyond 2 is ill advised

16. Decimals are preceded with a 0 (e.g. 0.85 not .85)

17. Hex codes are in all uppercase (e.g. #1A2B3C not #1a2b3C)

n.  This is a living document
